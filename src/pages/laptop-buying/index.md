When looking to purchase a new laptop, you'll be asking these 2 things a lot:

1. What are the specs?
2. How much will this cost me?

I'm not going to explain what most of the computer jargon on laptop specs sheet mean, you've got Google for that, but what this post can hopefully show you is that you can get the same (or even better) specs for a laptop for cheaper.

### Pricing and specs suck in the Philippines

I've done my due diligence, I've watched reviews, researched laptop prices, scoured the internet, visited electronic stores in malls and looked through olx.ph trying to find the best prices for laptops but I always end up with the same conclusion; You're better off buying in America. 

I don't understand why most laptops I see can range from $200 to $600 more expensive compared to one you can buy from Ebay or Amazon. 

Besides being more expensive most mall stores have laptops with, what I consider, less than ideal specs for a 2019 laptop. You'll see laptops specced out with 4 gigs of RAM, having only HDD storage, or worst of all only having both. 

I think all tech savvy people can agree that those specs are not fit for computing today. To be fair though, **most** laptops can have their RAM and storage upgraded, given the extra effort, but this is unacceptable when those same laptops with better specs can be bought for cheaper on Amazon or Ebay. 

### Comparing prices

_The prices in dollars are from Amazon and Ebay, and the prices in pesos are from Philippine stores._ 

Those pictures were actually taken from my local SM. I've also visited other malls and you can expect to find prices close to the ones above.

Those American prices are only from quick searches, you can find even better deals if you look hard enough. 

If you're considering buying secondhand, Ebay has better prices and better variety compared to local secondhand sites like OLX. You just have to be vigilant for the best prices though, some of the best deals get swooped up within hours of being posted on Ebay 

_"Alright I'm convinced, but how am I supposed to have them shipped to me and how much is shipping going to cost?"_ I'm glad you asked because...

### Ordering is easy

1. Make an account for services like [ShippingCart](https:www.shippingcart.com), [JohnnyAirPlus](https://johnnyairplus.com/), [Jinio](https://jinio.com.ph/), [My-ShoppingBox](https://my-shoppingbox.com/). 

_I've personally only ever used ShippingCart so most of this will be based on my experience with their service but the others should be pretty similar_
2. Order the product from your selected store and have it shipped to the US address provided
3. Wait for the package to arrive to your US address
4. Have it shipped to your **Philippine address**. 
5. Wait for it to arrive to the Philippines. This will vary from service to service but ShippingCart delivers straight to your doorstep.

ShippingCart calculates price by weighing the package or calculating the volume, and they take whichever costs more (I don't know how the others calculate price). Based on personal experience the cost of shipping has never exceeded $150, and most of the time will only cost anywhere between $20 - $80.

The amount of money you save is huge even after factoring in shipping. 

### My most recent experience

I bought a fully specced Dell XPS 15 9560 with a 4K screen for $950 (I paid around PHP56,000 for the laptop and shipping). 

When I compared it to the prices of the same used laptop model with **WORSE** specs (not 4k screen, less RAM and storage) the prices all hovered between PHP70,000 - PHP80,000. 

I essentially saved PHP15,000 and all I had to do was wait a week more to get my laptop, and I'm so happy I did.

### Possible downsides

Unfortunately there are downsides to this, so if any of the following make you feel uncomfortable, you may want to try something else

* Returning a product for warranty or defects may cost you more money in the case that you are unhappy with your product. This has never happened to me with all of my 12 orders, 3 of which were used laptops.

* You are going to have to wait around 2 weeks before you get your product, so if you need it ASAP try somewhere else.

**Disclaimer: If you are going to try this, please do it at your own risk! It is YOUR responsibility to evaluate whether the product or products you are buying are as advertised**
