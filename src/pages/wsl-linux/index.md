## Why I need Linux

Most people have their own reasons for sticking with Linux, and if I didn't need to make websites for work I would probably single boot Windows, but I do make websites and these little things matter.

1. Having the same environment on prod and development is a Godsend. If I knew that a thing worked locally on Linux, I'm 99% positive that it will be compatible with production.

2. Working on the command line beats working on a GUI when it comes to productivity. The command line is a pretty scary thing and I know some developers who would rather switch jobs than touch the command line. Admittedly it's a pretty steep learning curve, but it's worth it, also if you ever plan on deploying a somewhat complicated application with databases and security you can bet that you're going to need some basic knowledge working the command line as that is what you're going to use to talk with your server 100% of the time.

3. Customizability, this is probably the most cited reason why users stick with Linux. Personally I have my whole computer set up in a way that I will rarely need my mouse. I've got [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) set up as my main desktop environment, installed a Vim plugin for Visual Studio Code and installed [tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) on Firefox to allow complete navigation using only the keyboard.

There's countless reasons why people use Linux but these are definitely my top 3.

## Why I need Windows

Adobe and Steam.

There's an argument with gaming on Linux especially with the recent news with Proton, but I've tried an it's still not _smooth_ enough for me to want to transfer.

## Where dual booting and WSL come in

Well that's the dilemma mainly. For me especially in my line of work, I was far more productive in Linux, but I needed Photoshop for some other minor work and I still gamed from time to time.

The two most optimal solutions (in my opinion) is to either dual boot and more recently WSL.
