If you've ever wanted to buy things from the abroad but are intimidated by high shipping fees, customs tampering your packages, customs holding your package indefinitely or hate dealing with customs in general, ShippingCart might just be for you. Of course it's not a straight forward process and it could be intimidating at first, so if it's your first time read on as I detail what I did to order my products from eBay and have it shipped straight to my doorstep using ShippingCart.

### My experiences

I've been using ShippingCart for over a year now and I've had them deliver over a dozen items by now on multiple occasions, with products worth $10 to up to $1000. The most I've had to pay was $150 to ship straight to my door and the longest I've had to wait was 10 days.

### What is ShippingCart

You can think of ShippingCart as your own private US Address. You buy products and have them delivered to the address given to you by ShippingCart and from there have them deliver it straight to you, no need to deal with customs or other fees besides shipping fees.

### How do you order from the US?

There are 6 steps all in all and I outline them later on in the post with screenshots.

1. Create your account with ShippingCart
2. Select what you want to buy
3. Purchase your item and have it shipped to your ShippingCart address
4. Wait. When your package arrives at their warehouse, they will review the item and they will notify you when it's ready for shipping
5. Once your package is accepted, you will need to declare the value of the product you ordered, for insurance I think, ShippingCart will calculate the cost to ship the product to the Philippines.
6. Once calculated, you confirm which products you want shipped (if there are multiple products), proceed to the payment page, choose your preferred payment method, enter in your PHILIPPINE address if you have not done so before and in 5 to 10 days your product will arrive at your doorstep
7. (OPTIONAL) This goes for most shipments you receive not only from ShippingCart. Document yourself OPENING the sealed package, in the case that your package is damaged or is missing a product, you have video evidence to you can use to prove your claim.

### 1. Create your account with ShippingCart

So headover to [ShippingCart's home page](https:www.shippingcart.com) and click Sign Up

Fill in your info and then login.

At the landing page when you login, you should see this part at the left side of the screen containing a US Address and a UK Address. Take note of this, because this is what you enter as your shipping information when buying from the US or UK store.

### 2. Selecting what you want to buy

My favorite shop is definitely eBay but I'm sure most US based shops will do. I buy almost everything that can be had for cheaper on eBay, [things like laptops](/laptop-buying), cellphones, and most electronics and also clothing brands I would not normally find here in the Philippines. 

##### Just a tip a credit card is the best payment method I can suggest you have before attempting this. Most stores accept PayPal or debit cards but there are some stores that only accept credit cards. Just make sure you're diligent with paying off your debts on time

### 3. Purchase your item and have it shipped to your ShippingCart address

This is pretty straightforward. Most websites have you fill up your address before or while checking out, some have you enter your address to be stored with your account. Make sure you enter the address given to you by ShippingCart. 

##### Take note though that the shipping fee you pay here is separate from the shipping fee charged by ShippingCart 

### 4. Wait. When your package arrives at their warehouse, they will review the item and they will notify you when it's ready for shipping

This usually takes time, depending on where you shop it can take 2 - 7 days before your item gets to the US address. Most stores will provide a tracking number so find out what shipping company the store used get your tracking number and track your package's status there.

When your item finally arrives you're going to receive an email like this

That means that they're reviewing your package and measuring it for pricing.

### 5. Once your package is accepted, you will need to declare the value of the product you ordered, for insurance I think, ShippingCart will calculate the cost to ship the product to the Philippines.

After a day or two you will receive another email stating that your product has been accepted and is ready to be shipped. When you receive that, you can login to your ShippingCart account and click this Shipments tab

##### Screenshot

You should see your shipment and some pictures of your item. You can enter the cost of the item here and you should see on the right side the cost of getting your product shipped to the Philippines. That is all you have to pay, I've never had any hidden fees.

###### Tip: If you're planning to buy multiple items worth less than $500, it's best to have them all shipped at the same time, you save about $10 per item if you ship them together compared to shipping them separately. This doesn't apply to items worth over $500, in my experience items over $500 inflate the price you're going to pay so it's best you have those high value items shipped alone.

### 6. Once calculated, you confirm which products you want shipped (if there are multiple products), proceed to the payment page, choose your preferred payment method, enter in your PHILIPPINE address, and in 5 to 10 days your product will arrive at your doorstep

Once the cost is calculated and you're sure you have all the items you want to be shipped, click proceed to payment

You should then be redirected to the payment page which looks like this. Choose your desired payment method (Credit Card or PayPal only as far as I know) add your Philippine address if you haven't done so before and then click "Pay & Ship".

After that you will receive an email stating that your payment is being processed. If it fails, your products will be placed back to the Shipments page as pending shipment and you'll have to go through the process of paying again. If the payment is successful they will send you an email saying that your shipment is on it's way with an estimated date of arrival, usually 10 days after payment. In my experience most shipments take 5 - 7 days to arrive.

### 7. (OPTIONAL) This goes for most shipments you receive not only from ShippingCart. Document yourself OPENING the sealed package, in the case that your package is damaged or is missing a product, you have video evidence to you can use to prove your claim.

After 5 to 10 days of waiting, there should be an LBC delivery guy knocking at your door waiting for you (or a different representative) to sign for your package. I am lucky that after a dozen shipments I have never had a lost or damaged item but it's good to always be safe. So what I do is set up a video camera infront of me opening the SEALED package. In case an item is visibly damaged or an item is missing I can report it to LBC or ShippingCart with my proof.

### Final Thoughts

This all started late 2017 when I needed a laptop but was unsatisfied with the prices here in the Philippines. I calculated the price of buying the laptop and having it shipped to the Philippines and it equaled to me saving about $200 compared to buying it here in the Philippines. Since then I've bought various items from eBay and have always been satisfied with the service I receive. 

There are just so many items  available in sites like eBay or Amazon that just aren't available here locally. I made this in the hopes of helping out someone else intimidated by buying from abroad.

It is **YOUR** responsibility to evaluate whether the product or products you are buying are functional and as advertised. There is always a chance of buying a defective product or wanting to return your order no matter what you buy.
