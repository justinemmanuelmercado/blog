When I started to blog with this [laptop buying post](/laptop-buying), I never really had any plans to market it. But I did want people to get a chance to read the post. So I did what anyone without any SEO or marketing skills do when they want to get people to look at their blog; make a bot, have it run on an old Android and pester people on Reddit.

### Brainstorming

Well first I had to think of a way to get people to visit. So instead of the users finding the post, I let myself find the users. For the past few days I've been searching through the /r/SuggestALaptop subreddit for related posts and for the recent posts, I'd chime in with my 2 cents and make sure to link to my blog when appropriate. But doing this everyday is not really feasible, and sometimes I'd miss a few days. But do you know who doesn't miss any days monitoring the internet for traffic and specific words? Bots.
